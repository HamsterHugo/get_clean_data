# The final Assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data

This is my solution to the final Assignment of the course "Getting and Cleaning
data" in the Data Science Specialization.

# The exercise
The given raw data are measurements for recognition human activity using a smart phone. In more detail, 30 volunteers performed six activities, namely laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking upstairs and walking downstairs, wearing a smartphone. During the activities the smart phone captured via the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity. The data set was normalized to the interval [-1,1] and split into a training and a test set. The training set contains 70 %  and the test set contains 30 % of the data.

According to the Assignment it is the task to merge the training and test set, extract the mean and standard deviation measurements, add the subject column and the activity column and summarize the average of all measurements for each subject and each activity in a tidy data set.

It contains the following files:
- This *README.md* file,  
- the folder *UCI HAR Dataset*, containing the raw data,  
- the *Codebook*, explaining the variables,  
- the *tidy_data_set.txt* file, which contains the tidy data set according to the
exercise,  
- the *run_analysis.R* file, that generated the *tidy_data_set.txt* file.
